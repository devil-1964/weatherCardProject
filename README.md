I made a weather card using HTML, CSS, Tailwind, and Javascript. It is a project to enhance my basics of Javascript DOM and API. I used an API, if you want to run this project live sign up the API I used in this project and fill it in the *script.js* file in the **const apiKey**.

## Working
I just used Javascript DOM to change the *innerHTML* which I got from the API data.
